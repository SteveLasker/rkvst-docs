## What is verified domain?

Domain verification assures that actors claiming to be part of an organization are in fact authorized to share information on their behalf. If an organization has verified their domain, you will see a badge indicating that they have been verified by the RKVST team when viewing shared or [publicly attested information](../public-attestation/).
