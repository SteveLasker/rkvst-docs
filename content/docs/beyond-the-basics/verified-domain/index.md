## What is domain verification?

Domain verification assures that actors claiming to be part of an organization are authorized to share information on their behalf. If an organization's tenancy has been verified by the RKVST team, a badge indicating that they have been verified will appear next to their domain name.

**Note:** Having a verified domain is different from a `Tenant Display Name`. Tenant display names are internal, appearing only within your own tenancy, and are not visible to anyone you share with. A verified domain name must be set by the RKVST team, and will be visible to actors outside your tenancy.

## Why is it important to verify my organization's domain?

Getting your organization's domain verified indicates that you are who you say you are to those you wish to share with. This helps close the trust gap inherent to information sharing between organizations or with the public.

Without domain verification, the `Organisation` is noted as the publisher's Tenant ID. Verifying your domain not only shows that this information comes from a legitamate actor on behalf of the organization, but also replaced the Tenant ID with your domain name so consumers can more easily identify the publishing organization. For example, someone attesting information on behalf of RKVST would have `rkvst.com`.

## How can I get my organization's domain verified? 

The RKVST team is happy to help you obtain your verified domain badge. Please contact support@rkvst.com from an email address which includes the domain you wish to verify. For example, email us from @rkvst.com to verify the rkvst.com domain. 

## How does RKVST verify my organization's domain?

RKVST uses the following criteria to assess a request for domain verification:

* The request email has come from the same domain as the organization (i.e. @rkvst.com for rkvst.com)
* The email address is valid and has not been masked
* If the user is known to the RKVST team, the request should match the records we have for their tenancy
* Social media records such as LinkedIn and Twitter match the request

If the request passes these criteria, our team will add your verified domain to your tenancy and notify you that your request has been completed.
