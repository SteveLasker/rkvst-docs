## What is verified domain?

Domain verification assures that actors claiming to be part of an organization are authorized to share information on their behalf. If an organization's tenancy has been verified by the RKVST team, a badge indicating that they have been verified will appear next to their domain when viewing shared or [publicly attested information](../public-attestation/).

**Note:** Having a verified domain is different from your `Tenant Display Name`. Tenant display names are internal, appearing only within your own tenancy, and are not visible to anyone you share with. A verified domain name must be set by the RKVST team, and will be visible to actors outside your tenancy.

## Why is it important to verify my organization's domain?

Getting your organization's domain verified indicates that you are who you say you are to those you wish to share with. This helps close the trust gap inherent to information sharing between organizations or with the public.

Without domain verification, the `Organisation` is noted as the publisher's Tenant ID. Verifying your domain not only shows that this information comes from a legitamate actor on behalf of the organization, but also replaced the Tenant ID with your domain name. For example, someone attesting information on behalf of RKVST would show `rkvst.com`.
