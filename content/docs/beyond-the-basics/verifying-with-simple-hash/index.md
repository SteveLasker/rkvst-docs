Verifying your Simple Hash events provides an additional layer of security to your data, so you can ensure the information you have at a given time has not changed.

To verify your data, you may use the [RKVST Simple Hash tool](https://github.com/jitsuin-inc/rkvst-simplehash-python), available on GitHub. 

Please note that with Simple Hash, events are committed to the RKVST blockchain as a batch. Events with the blue tick have been committed to the blockchain as part of a batch, and will have a `Transaction ID`. With the free tier of RKVST, Simple Hash batched commits happen every 30 days by default. If the tick mark is grey, your event has been confirmed in the system but not yet committed to the blockchain. **Your event(s) must have a blue tick for transaction details to be available for data verification.**

## Step-by-Step Guide for Using the Simple Hash Tool 

1. Retrieve your transaction information. This will give you the inputs you need in later steps to check the hash for that batch of events. 

{{< tabs name="retrieve-transaction-info" >}}
{{{< tab name="UI" >}}
Select `Auditor View` from the sidebar and select a `Transaction` from the Events Overview List.

Copy the `start time` and `end time` from the transaction details. These will be used as inputs to the [RKVST Simple Hash tool](https://github.com/jitsuin-inc/rkvst-simplehash-python).

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Command Line" >}}
The [Blockchain API](../../api-reference/blockchain-api/) allows you to fetch transactions for an event. 

Using the Event ID as a parameter, run the following command: 

```bash
curl -v -X GET \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v1alpha2/blockchain/assets/<asset-id>/events/<event-id>
```
See instructions for [creating your `BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`](https://docs.rkvst.com/docs/rkvst-basics/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations/) here.

This will return a list of matching blockchain transactions, as well as the `simple_hash_details`. Copy the `start_time` and `end_time` values to be used as inputs to the [RKVST Simple Hash tool](https://github.com/jitsuin-inc/rkvst-simplehash-python).

2. Use the [RKVST Simple Hash tool](https://github.com/jitsuin-inc/rkvst-simplehash-python) to generate the hash of your events. 

{{< tabs name="simple-hash-script" >}}
{{{< tab name="Python" >}}
Use Python pip utility to install the `rkvst-simplehash` package. This package is supported for Python versions 3.7, 3.8, 3.9, and 3.10.

```bash
python3 -m pip install rkvst-simplehash
```

You may then use the code to recreate the hash:

```python
from rkvst_simplehash.v1 import hash_events

simplehash = hash_events(events)
```

{{< /tab >}}
{{< tab name="Command Line" >}}
Enter the query information you copied in the last step and run the command. See instructions for [creating your `BEARER_TOKEN_FILE`](https://docs.rkvst.com/docs/rkvst-basics/getting-access-tokens-using-app-registrations/) here.

To install locally, execute this command after cloning the [repo](https://github.com/jitsuin-inc/rkvst-simplehash-python):

```bash
python3 -m pip install bencode.py~=4.0

URL="https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v2/assets/-/events"
SINCE=timestamp_accepted_since=2022-10-19T00:00:00Z
BEFORE=timestamp_accepted_before=2022-11-19T00:00:00Z
BEARER_TOKEN_FILE=credentials/token

curl -s -X GET \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     "$URL?proof_mechanism=SIMPLE_HASH&${SINCE}&${BEFORE}" | rkvst_simplehash/v1.py
```

Or, use a virtual environment and published wheel:

```bash
python3 -m venv simplehash-venv
source simplehash-venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install rkvst_simplehash

URL="https://app.rkvst.io/archivist/v2/assets/-/events"
SINCE=timestamp_accepted_since=2022-10-19T00:00:00Z
BEFORE=timestamp_accepted_before=2022-10-26T00:00:00Z
BEARER_TOKEN_FILE=credentials/token

curl -s -X GET \
     -H "@$BEARER_TOKEN_FILE" \
     "$URL?proof_mechanism=SIMPLE_HASH&${SINCE}&${BEFORE}" | rkvst_simplehashv1

deactivate
rm -rf simplehash-venv
```

3. Compare the hash from your `Transaction Details` to the hash generated by the tool. If they match, your event history has not changed.
