Jitsuin RKVST is a Data Assurance Hub that proves When Who Did What to Assets. 

It enables enterprises to build trust in Multi-Party data through greater transparency. 

RKVST permanently records shared asset evidence to bring the right level of trust in data for faster, confident decisions with lower business risk by:

**Metadata Governance** - Empower the right people in organizations to set, enforce and execute complex data sharing policies.

**Authenticated Provenance** - Deliver full traceability on all internal and external data sources to speed and assure critical decisions.

**Continuous Accountability** - Instantly auditable evidence “Proves When Who Did What” for any shared asset to delight your GRC team.

RKVST delivers assured metadata in a single line of code and makes recording and auditing the full lifecycle of an asset simple: any authorized participant (including an agent or endpoint on a connected device) can register the events they know about, from which all participants can see a relevant aggregate picture of the asset’s maintenance and operational history. By understanding When Who Did What, human actors and software/AI systems can make stronger real-time judgments about the trustworthiness of a device and the data it produces.
