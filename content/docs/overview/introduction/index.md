Jitsuin RKVST is an asset lifecycle assurance system built to lower business risk. 

It enables enterprises to reveal, reduce and report risks introduced through connected devices and Digital Transformation. 

RKVST maintains a Full Service History for assets by keeping a permanent shared record of When Who Did What to a Thing. Following the principle that you can’t secure what you can’t see, this level of visibility and traceability is key to lowering the risk of business transformation.

RKVST makes recording and auditing the full lifecycle of an asset simple: any authorized participant (including an agent or endpoint on the device itself) can register the events they know about, from which all participants can see a relevant aggregate picture of the asset’s maintenance and operational history. 

By knowing When Who Did What to a Thing human actors and connected systems can make stronger judgments about the trustworthiness of a device and the data it produces.
